Command Mode: In command mode, actions are taken on the file. The vi editor starts in command mode. Here, the typed words will act as commands in vi editor. To pass a command, you need to be in command mode.
Insert Mode: In insert mode, entered text will be inserted into the file. The Esc key will take you to the command mode from insert mode.
