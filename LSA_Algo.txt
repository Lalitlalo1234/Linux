How to Install RHEL 6.9 From Online:
To install RHEL 6.9 on your computer, you can follow these steps:
1. Download the RHEL 6.9 ISO from the internet archive by visiting this link:
[https://archive.org/download/rhel-server-6.9-x86_64-dvd/rhel-server-6.9-x86_64-dvd.iso]
2. Install VMware or VirtualBox on your computer. If you have a low-end PC, it's recommended to use
VirtualBox.
3. Open the virtualization software and create a new virtual machine.
4. When setting up the virtual machine, browse and select the RHEL 6.9 ISO file you downloaded in
Step 1 as the installation source.
5. Start the virtual machine. During the boot process, you will see an option to "Install RHEL." Press
the "Tab" key when this option appears.
6. After pressing "Tab," a prompt will appear. Type in "askmethod" (without quotes) and then press
"Enter."
7. Now, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
You will be prompted to configure necessary packages and settings during the installation process.

For RHEL 6 or those who are not having vsftpd,samba like packages preinstalled:
1. Create an oracle or redhat account but not personal a company profile (give test details)
https://www.redhat.com/en
Note Username and password
Or use common account only for nkt students 2023
nktpta202324@gmail.com
123redhatRr@
2. Open cmd with root privileges
$su 3. $subscription-manager register
Enter oracle username and password
4. $subscription-manager list --available
Find the pool ID which can copy using control+shift+c and paste control+shift+v
5. $subscription-manager attach --pool = Your Pool ID
After successful installation we can install any package from red hat repositories(Server)

1. Advanced commands

Piping
send the result of a command to another command
e,g ps + less
a = show processes for all users
u = display the process's user/owner
x = also show processes not attached to a terminal
# ps aux | less
| is used to combine two cmds
Redirection
sends the output of a command to a file
# ps aux > ~/test.txt
(~ - creates test file in home dir)
>
Overwrite(del prev)

Practical 6: Samba Server (lin from win)
In latest windows 10 and 11 by default SMB 1.0 is disabled and SMB client version 4 is not supported in rhel 6
To Enable it :
1. Press start button and search turn windows features on or off
2. Enable this SMB 1.0 as sh\own in figure
3. Restart the pc

4.

Make Sure Your virtual machine is connected to host using Bridged Adapter
1. $rpm -q samba samba-common samba-client
2. $rpm -qa | grep samba
If not installed then install using
$yum install samba
//If it gives package not found error then register your system using the steps given in first page
3. $su Enter password
4. $cd /
5. $mkdir myshare
6. cd /myshare
7. $touch file1
8. $vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
In Global make Workgroup name as = WORKGROUP
Add this line in last
[myshare]
comment = any comment
path = /myshare
writable = yes
browseable = yes
9. $testparm

//to check syntactical errors

//It will display default_t label which needs to be set to samba_share to enable edting system files
$chcon -t samba_share_t /myshare
$service iptables stop
$useradd test
$smbpasswd -a test
Password 123
17. $service smb start
18. $service nmb start
//To use hostname instead of ip addresses nmb package is used
19.

$smbclient -U test -L localhost

//to check details of share

$ip addr show or $hostname

//make sure internet is connected check eth ip address

Now open cmd in windows os to test connection between rhel and windows
In windows cmd
20. Ping your rhel ip address or hostname to verify connection
e,g $ping 192.168.31.172 OR

//if packets sent 4 and received 4 then successful connection is established

e,g $ping mylinuxpc

//if packets sent 4 and received 4 then successful connection is established Here mylinux pc is hostname of rhel

21. Open windows explorer and right click network and click map network drive In folder textbox enter rhel server ip address
e,g \\192.168.31.172\myshare
OR
e,g \\mylinuxpc\myshare
Enter username and password
Username test
Password 123
Now we can read and write or sync linux Folder from windows in realtime all the files in /myshare dir from both the os.

1. Press Ctrl + Alt + Del
2. Click Change a password
3. Keep Old Password Empty
4. Enter new Password 123

OR
Step 1
Create a new test user account with password
1. Press windows button and search other users
2. Click Someone else to this pc
3. Click I don’t have person`s sign in info
4. Click add a user without microsoft acc
5. Enter username test
Pass 123
6. Restart and login to test account in windows

Step 2
Login and open cmd and enter ipconfig (Note the ip address)
Open Windows Explorer and create a new folder test in C:/
Right click on folder And go to properties click Sharing -> Share -> Share
(To Allow modifying click advance -> permission -> click full control allow)
Step 3
Now In Linux OS Vmware enter

$smbclient //windows_ip_address/share_name -U windows_username
e,g
$smbclient //192.168.129.228/test -U MyWinPC

smb>Enter SMB commands which are as follows
$ls

List files in the shared windows folder.

$get filename

Download a file from the shared folder.

$put filename

Upload a file to the shared folder.

$cd foldername Change directory.
$exit

To exit windows folder

Optional
Other Workarounds :
Create and log on to same student account username and password on both windows and linux
Check/change workgroup name in windows as WORKGROUP.

Practical 9: GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)
Description :
1] Default:The default command specifies which menu entry will be booted by default if the user doesn't make a selection within
the timeout period.
This is usually set to a numerical index corresponding to a menu entry.
2]Time out:The set timeout command defines the time (in seconds) that the boot menu is displayed before the default entry is
automatically booted.
3]Hidden menu:In GRUB configuration files, the "hiddenmenu" option is used to control whether the GRUB menu is hidden or shown
during system startup.
When "hiddenmenu" is enabled, the GRUB menu is not displayed by default, and it only appears if certain conditions
are met or if the user explicitly activates it.
4]Title:In GRUB configuration files, the "title" is a descriptive label for an entry in the boot menu.
It is not the actual title that appears in the boot menu itself but a human-readable identifier that helps users
understand which entry corresponds to which operating system or configuration.
5]Root:In a GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) configuration file, the term "root" is typically used to specify the root filesystem
for a particular boot menu entry.
It represented in a format like (hdX,Y) for hard drive X, partition Y.
6]kernel:In a GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) configuration file, the "kernel" (often spelled as "linux" in GRUB configuration
files) is a directive that specifies the location of the Linux kernel image that should be loaded when a particular boot
menu entry is selected.
7]initrd:The initrd line specifies the location of the initial RAM disk (initramfs or initrd.img) that is loaded along with the kernel.
The initrd image is used to provide additional modules and drivers needed for the kernel to properly mount the root
filesystem and complete the boot process.
